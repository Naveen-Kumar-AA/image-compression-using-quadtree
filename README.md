# QuadTree Image Compression

This script implements a quadtree-based image compression algorithm using Python. The quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. This script compresses an image by recursively dividing it into quadrants until the detail level in each quadrant is below a specified threshold or a maximum depth is reached.
